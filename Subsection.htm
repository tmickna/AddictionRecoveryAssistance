                <p>Alcoholism is a condition that affects millions of
                individuals. A formal definition would describe alcolism as "The inability
                 to control drinking due to both a physical and emotional dependence on
                 alcohol." A clinical definition does not accurately and completely describe
                 this disease as it can manifest itself quite differently between those
                 who suffer from it.</p>
                 <p>Recently, the term "Alcoholism", has been changed to "Alcohol
                 Use Disorder". </p>
